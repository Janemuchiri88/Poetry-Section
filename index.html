          <h3>I obeyed every command</h3>

          <p>He wrapped his arms around me,<br>
          I could feel his heart chugging,<br>
          But this was a melody to my ears,<br>
          His love was all that mattered to me,<br>
          Through his brown eyes,<br>
          I could see his passion.</p>

            <p class="p-2">As we walked down the beach, <br>
              we held hands as our feet were, <br>
              immersed in the sand, <br>
              The chilly water slowly greeted our toes, <br>
              And te cool wind caressed my bare back. <br>

          <h3>He made me weak</h3>
          <p>His touch sent chills down my 
            spine, <br>
            His gentle kisses around my neck, <br>
            made me weak,
            His fire ignited and rose the beast,<br>
            I couldn't hold back anymore,<br>
            I obeyed every command.
